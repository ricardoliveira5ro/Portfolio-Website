                <p>Programming enthusiast, I recently completed my degree as a <span class="spanYellow">Software Engineer</span> at Polytechnic Institute of Set√∫bal and started my first professional experience.</p>
                <p>This coding passion began when I was 16, I started teaching myself by watching small courses and practicing basic functionalities. This was before I went to college, where I learned the art of programming and studied many technologies.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I prioritize my <span class="spanBlue">personal development</span> by working on projects that will help me improve my technical skills.</p>
                <p>Aside from technology, I am a passionate <span class="spanRed">football</span> fan and <span class="spanGreen">hip-hop</span> music lover</p>
